# DEVELOPING #
 - Need to search for and figure out how to deal with any properties specified in the handler source files. Just hard-code debugMode as false and ScriptName as "htcLib". 
 - The clickAtCoords needs the additional property clickCommandPosix, set to ../vendor/cliclick/cliclick. 


# WAITING #
 - If the compiled handler file already exists and has the same version, can skip recompiling (if that actually improves speed).
 - Consider removing all the "if debugMode thenâ€¦" (logging, etc) from the handler source files.
