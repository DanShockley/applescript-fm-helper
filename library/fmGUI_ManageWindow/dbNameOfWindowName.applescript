-- return the database name of the specified window


(*
HISTORY:
	2024-07-16 ( danshockley ): For the FileMaker-specific dictionary, used handler getFmAppPath (works-with-FM19+). 
	2024-07-15 ( danshockley ): Updated to tell app by process ID (works-with-FM19+). 
	1.5.1 - 2018-12-07 ( eshagdar ): not specifying someWindowName uses the frontmost window.
	1.5 - 2018-09-20 ( eshagdar ): FM17 only has one version ( everything is pro ), so talk to FM by name instead of id.
	1.4.1 - 2017-08-02 ( eshagdar ): FM15 has the host name after the name of the database.
	1.4 - 2017-01-13 ( eshagdar ): updated for FM15 - handle script workspace
	1.3 - handle specially-named windows ("Manage xxx for�" and so on)
	1.2 - fix to work when the Edit Script script name has parentheses ITSELF.
	1.1 - works when Manage Scripts or Manage Layouts is open and in front.
	

REQUIRES:
	getTextBetween
	parseChars
